# Sensitivity-Analysis

This is project was done as a part of my coursework for " ... " course at GMU.

### Objective:


### Algorithms & Analysis:
Network Algorithms used on GSA travel scheduling data
Performed different Network algorithms such as Dijkstra, Floyd Warshall, Bellman Ford and Johnson's 
to evaluate travel costs and determining the least expensive conference site for employees at different cities.
Further using Sensitivity Analysis to identify key variables that affects the cost and benefits of the company.
