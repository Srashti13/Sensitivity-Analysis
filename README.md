# Sensitivity-Analysis

This is project was done as a part of my coursework for " Deterministic Models " course at GMU.

### Objective:
We want a method for evaluating travel costs and determining the least expensive conference site from over 216 US cities.

### Data
![data pic](Datasetsnap.PNG)


### Algorithms & Analysis:

**Shortest path Algorithm**
The shortest path problem is the problem of finding a path between two vertices (or nodes) in a network such that the sum of the weights of its constituent edges is minimized.

Different Network Algorithms as applied such as:
- Dijkstra Algorithm
- Bellman ford Algorithm
- Johnson Algorithm
- Floyd Warshall Algorithm

### Sensitivity Analysis:
The technique used to determine how independent variable values will impact a particular dependent variable under a given set of assumptions is defined as sensitive analysis.

Its importance is that it helps in identifying the key variables that are major influence in the cost and benefits of the project.
